## Background 
This study aimed to evaluate the clinical performance of p16/Ki-67 dual staining in the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3 or worse (CIN2+/CIN3+) in Chinese women. 

## Methods 
Cervical exfoliated cells were collected from 537 eligible women and were used for liquid-based cytology (LBC), p16/Ki-67 dual staining, and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing. All women received colposcopy with biopsies taken at abnormal sites. Histopathological diagnoses were used as the gold standard. 

## Results 
p16/Ki-67 staining had a positivity rate of 43.58% overall; the rate increased significantly with histological severity (p <0.001). The sensitivities of p16/ki-67 for detecting CIN2+ and CIN3+ were 88.10% and 91.30%, respectively. Compared with high-risk HPV (HR-HPV), sensitivity of p16/Ki-67 was lower for detecting CIN2+ (88.10% versus 95.71%), but similar for detecting CIN3+ (91.30% versus 96.27%). Specificities of p16/Ki-67 were 85.02% for detecting CIN2+ and 76.86% for detecting CIN3+, values similar to those for LBC (84.71% for CIN2+, 80.05% for CIN3+) but higher than those for HR-HPV (62.77% for CIN2+, 71.25% for CIN3+). All the tests performed better in women>30 years. With respect to the performance of triage for women with ASC-US, sensitivities of p16/Ki-67 were 86.36% for detecting CIN2+ and 83.33% for detecting CIN3+, values similar to those of HR-HPV. However, specificities of p16/Ki-67 were both higher than those of HR-HPV (85.96% versus 67.54% for CIN2+, 79.84% versus 62.90% for CIN3+). 

## Conclusion 
P16/Ki-67 dual staining could probably provide an optional method for China's national cervical cancer screening, and could also be considered as an efficient method of triage for managing women with ASC-US.
