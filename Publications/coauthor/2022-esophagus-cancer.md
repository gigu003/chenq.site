## Background
It is great of significance to figure the time-trend of esophageal cancer (EC) and its current status for effective prevention and control, especially in EC high risk areas. As one of world-renowned high-risk areas, the epidemiology of EC in Henan has not been recently updated. Therefore, we aimed to depict the status quo of EC and analyze its time-trend in Henan.

## Methods
The EC data were extracted from the Henan Provincial Cancer registry database derived from the population based cancer registry system, which covered 30.51% of the whole population in Henan and were qualified according to national and international guidelines. The incidence and mortality of EC were estimated by area (rural/urban), gender, and age groups. The age-standardized rates (ASRs) were calculated according to the Segi's population. Joinpoint regression was used to calculate annual percentage change (APC) and average annual percentage change (AAPC) to evaluate the time-trend of EC.

## Results
As estimated, there were 29,913 new EC cases in Henan, 2018. The crude incidence and the age-standardized incidence rate by world standard population (ASIRW) was 27.43/105 and 19.96/105, respectively. The incidence in males and rural was 1.83 and 1.51 times higher than that in females and urban areas, respectively. Meanwhile, it was estimated that 22,688 deaths occurred in 2018. The crude mortality and the age-standardized mortality rate by world standard population (ASMRW) were 20.80/105 and 14.47/105, respectively. Similarly, males and rural areas had higher mortality compared with females and urban areas. The age-specific incidence and mortality of EC showed significant increasing after 60-64 years group. In general, the time-trend of incidence (APC: -8.9, P<0.001) and mortality (APC: -7.6, P<0.001) of EC showed a significant decreasing trend since 2014, and downward trend were also observed in rural areas for incidence (APC: -5.2, P<0.001) and mortality (APC: -3.9, P<0.001) from 2010 to 2018.

## Conclusions
The EC incidence and mortality in Henan has exhibited a significant declining trend in past years. Nonetheless, the disease burden remains high, especially in males and rural areas. Therefore, the ongoing prevention and control strategies of EC should be maintained alongside the establishment of more effective strategies.
