## Background
The disease burden of lung cancer is high in Henan province, China, it is out of the utmost significance to figure the current epidemic status and temporal trend of lung cancer for effective prevention and control.

## Methods
The qualified data was obtained from the Henan Provincial Central Cancer Registry of China, covering 30.51% of the whole population. Incidence, mortality, proportions, and cumulative rates (among patients aged 0-74 years old) of lung cancer by areas, sex and age groups were estimated. The world Segi's standard population was applied to calculate the age-standardized rate. Joinpoint regression was used to calculate annual percentage change (APC) and average annual percentage change (AAPC) to evaluate temporal trends from 2010 to 2018.

## Results
In 2018, there were about 55,344 new cases of lung cancer in Henan province, with the crude incidence of 50.75/100,000, the age-standardized incidence rate by world standard (Segi's) population (ASIRW) of 37.14/100,000, and the cumulative rate of 4.57%. About 41,782 people died from lung cancer in 2018, with the crude mortality rate of 38.31/100,000, the age-standardized mortality rate by world standard (Segi's) population (ASMRW) of 27.09/100,000, and the cumulative rate of 3.22%. The age-specific incidence and mortality of lung cancer increased gradually as age increased and reached the peak at the age of 85+ years. The overall ASIRW (AAPC =0.3, P=0.531) and ASMRW (AAPC =-0.2, P=0.687) remained stable from 2010 to 2018, but decreased in urban areas from 2014 to 2018 (APC for ASIRW =-4.7, P=0.023; APC for ASMRW =-5.3, P=0.012). From 2010 to 2018, the incidence rate increased in the rural population aged 75+ years old (AAPC =4.2, P=0.023).

## Conclusions
The incidence and mortality rates of lung cancer significantly decreased in urban areas partly due to the Cancer Screening Program in Urban China. Nonetheless, the disease burden remains high, especially in males and elderly population. Comprehensive prevention and control programs, such as smoking cessation intervention, screening, early diagnosis and early treatment programs, need to be implemented to reduce the burden of lung cancer.
