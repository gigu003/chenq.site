## Background
Henan province is an area with a serious disease burden of colorectal cancer (CRC) in China. Understanding the current incidence and mortality and the time-trend is critical to formulate and optimize prevention and control strategies for CRC. However, the current incidence and mortality and time-trend of CRC in Henan province, China have not been reported.

## Methods
CRC data was got from the Henan Provincial Central Cancer Registry of China in which the data was submitted from local cancer registries. Combined with the census data, the incidence, mortality, proportion, age-standardized rate by Chinese population (ASRC), age-standardized rate by world population (ASRW), and cumulative incidence and mortality (0-74 years old) of CRC by urban and rural population, gender, and age groups were estimated. The average annual percentage change (AAPC) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) of ASRC from 2010 to 2017 were analyzed.

## Results
In 2017, it was estimated that there were 20,275 new cases and 10,046 deaths of CRC in Henan province. The crude incidence was 18.73/100,000, with an age-standardized incidence rate by Chinese population (ASIRC) of 13.97/100,000 and age-standardized mortality rate by world population (ASIRW) of 13.78/100,000. The cumulative incidence was 1.66%. The mortality rate was 9.28/100,000, with an age-standardized mortality rate by Chinese population (ASMRC) of 6.49/100,000 and an age-standardized mortality rate by world population (ASMRW) of 6.45/100,000. The cumulative mortality rate was 0.69%. The ASIRC and ASMRC were higher in urban areas (15.89/100,000, 7.19/100,000) than in rural areas (13.13/100,000, 6.20/100,000), and higher in males (15.53/100,000, 7.44/100,000) than in females (12.48/100,000, 5.66/100,000). The age-specific incidence reached the peak at age of 80-84, and the age-specific mortality reached the peak at age 85. From 2010 to 2017, the overall ASIRC and ASMRC showed a steady trend (P>0.05), while an upward trend was observed in the mortality rate in urban males (AAPC =3.4, 95% CI: 0.2-6.7, P=0.040).

## Conclusions
The incidence and mortality of CRC were high in Henan province, and higher in urban areas and males. It is critical to strengthen the prevention and control of CRC, carry out targeted intervention, and promote screening and early diagnosis and treatment, particularly among urban areas and males.
