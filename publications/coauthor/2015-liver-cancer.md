## Objective 
Liver cancer is one of the most common types of cancer. We aimed to use the cancer registration data in 2015 to estimate the incidence and mortality of liver cancer in Henan province.

## Methods
The data from 37 population-based cancer registries in Henan province were collected for this study. The pooled data were stratified by area, sex, and age group. New cases of liver cancer and deaths due to the disease were estimated using age-specific rates and provincial population in 2015. All incidence and death rates were age standardized to the 2000 Chinese standard population and Segi's population, which were expressed per 100,000 populations.

## Results
After clearance and assessment, data from 30 population-based cancer registries (5 in urban and 25 in rural areas) were included in the analysis. All 30 cancer registries encompassed a total population of 23,421,609 (3,507,984 in urban and 19,913,625 in rural areas), accounting for 21.84% of the provincial population. The proportion of morphological verification (MV%), percentage of cancer cases identified with death certification only (DCO%), and mortality-to-incidence ratio (M/I) were 38.55%, 2.34%, and 0.81, respectively. Approximately 31,639 new cases of liver cancer were diagnosed and 26,057 deaths from liver cancer occurred in Henan in 2015. The crude incidence rate of liver cancer was 27.05/100,000 (36.24/100,000 in men and 17.35/100,000 in women). Age-standardized incidence rates by Chinese standard population and world standard population were 21.10/100,000 and 20.95/100,000, respectively. Liver cancer was more common in men than in women. The incidence rates in urban (26.31/100,000) and rural (27.18/100,000) areas were similar. The crude mortality rate of liver cancer was 21.98/100,000 (29.33/100,000 in males and 14.22/100,000 in females). Age-standardized mortality rates by Chinese standard population and world standard population were 16.93/100,000 and 16.90/100,000, respectively. There was no distinct difference in mortality rates of liver cancer between urban (22.55/100,000) and rural (21.87/100,000) areas.

## Conclusions
Liver cancer has posed a heavy burden on people in Henan province. Comprehensive measures should be conducted to prevent the increase in the incidence of liver cancer.
